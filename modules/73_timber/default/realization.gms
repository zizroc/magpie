*' @description In this realization, aggregated timber demand for wood and woodfuel 
*' `pm_demand_forestry` is calculated based on demand equation from @lauri_timber_demand
*' and income elasticities from @morland2018supply. See @mishra_forestry_2021 for more details. 
*' This realization can also account for construction wood demand based on 
*' @churkina2020buildings which is added on top of industrial roundwood demand (see @mishra_timbercities_2022).
*' Timber can be produced from both timber plantations `vm_prod_forestry` provided by [32_forestry] 
*' and natural vegetation `vm_prod_natveg` provided by [35_natveg]. 

*' @limitations Timber demand cannot be determined endogenously
