*' @description In this realization, total cropland equals the sum of croparea,  
*' fallow land and tree cover on cropland. Correspondingly, cropland carbon stocks consist 
*' of carbons stocks for croparea, fallow land and tree cover on cropland.
*' The development of fallow land and tree cover on cropland depends on targets defined 
*' as a certain fraction of total cropland. These targets can be either exogenously enforced 
*' (rule-based) or endogenously incentivized by a penalty term, which enters the objective function. 

*' This realisation also includes the option to reserve a minimum semi-natural
*' vegetation share within the total available cropland for other land cover
*' classes, including grassland, forest, and other land (by a given target year),
*' in order to provide species habitats and to benefit from ecosystem ervices in
*' agricultural landscapes.

*' @limitations There are currently no known limitations of this realization.
