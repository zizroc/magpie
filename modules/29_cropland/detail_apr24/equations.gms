*' We assume that crop production can only take place on suitable cropland area.

*' to estimate the available cropland area. The cultivated area therefore has
*' to be smaller than the available cropland area. Moreover, the available cropland
*' can be reduced by constraining the cropland area in favour of other land types,
*' in order to increase compositional heterogeneity of land types at the cell level.
