*' @description In this realization, total cropland equals croparea because 
*' fallow land and tree cover on cropland are fixed to zero. 
*' Therefore, also cropland carbon stocks consist only of croparea carbon stocks.
*' Biodiversity BII values are fixed to zero. 
*' Costs are fixed to zero. 

*' This realisation also includes the option to reserve a minimum semi-natural
*' vegetation share within the total available cropland for other land cover
*' classes, including grassland, forest, and other land (by a given target year),
*' in order to provide species habitats and to benefit from ecosystem ervices in
*' agricultural landscapes.

*' @limitations Fallow land and tree cover on cropland are fixed to zero
