*' We assume that crop production can only take place on suitable cropland area.
*' We use a suitability index (SI) map from @zabel_global_2014 to exclude areas
*' from cropland production that have a low suitability, e.g. due to steep slopes,
*' to estimate the available cropland area. The cultivated area therefore has
*' to be smaller than the available cropland area.

*' The semi-natural vegetation constraint for cropland areas has been suggested at the per square
