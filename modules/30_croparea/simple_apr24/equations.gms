*' Agricultural production is calculated by multiplying the area under
*' production with corresponding yields. Production from rainfed and irrigated
*' areas is summed up:

 q30_prod(j2,kcr) ..
  vm_prod(j2,kcr) =e= sum(w, vm_area(j2,kcr,w) * vm_yld(j2,kcr,w));

*' A penalty is applied for the violation of bioenergy tree (betr) rules.
*' The penalty applies to the missing bioenergy tree land, i.e. where bioenergy tree land 
*' is lower than a certain fraction of total cropland.

  q30_betr_missing(j2)$(sum(ct, i30_betr_penalty(ct)) > 0) ..
    v30_betr_missing(j2) =g=
      vm_land(j2,"crop") * sum(ct, i30_betr_target(ct,j2)) - vm_area(j2,"betr","rainfed");

  q30_cost(i2) ..
    vm_rotation_penalty(i2) =g=
      sum(cell(i2,j2), v30_betr_missing(j2) * sum(ct, i30_betr_penalty(ct)));

*' As additional constraints minimum and maximum rotational constraints limit
*' the placing of crops. On the one hand, these rotational constraints reflect
*' crop rotations limiting the share a specific crop can cover of the total area
*' of a cluster:

 q30_rotation_max(j2,crpmax30,w) ..
   sum((crp_kcr30(crpmax30,kcr)), vm_area(j2,kcr,w)) =l=
     sum(kcr, vm_area(j2,kcr,w)) * f30_rotation_max_shr(crpmax30);


*' On the other hand, it reflects boundary conditions such as minimum self
*' sufficiency constraints:

 q30_rotation_min(j2,crpmin30,w) ..
   sum((crp_kcr30(crpmin30,kcr)), vm_area(j2,kcr,w)) =g=
     sum(kcr, vm_area(j2,kcr,w)) * f30_rotation_min_shr(crpmin30);


*' The carbon stocks of the above ground carbon pools are calculated based on croparea and related carbon density.

  q30_carbon(j2,ag_pools) ..
    vm_carbon_stock_croparea(j2,ag_pools) =e=
      sum((kcr,w), vm_area(j2,kcr,w)) * sum(ct, fm_carbon_density(ct,j2,"crop",ag_pools));


*' The biodiversity value for cropland is calculated separately for annual and perennial crops:

  q30_bv_ann(j2,potnatveg) .. 
    vm_bv(j2,"crop_ann",potnatveg) =e=
      sum((crop_ann30,w), vm_area(j2,crop_ann30,w)) * fm_bii_coeff("crop_ann",potnatveg) * fm_luh2_side_layers(j2,potnatveg);

  q30_bv_per(j2,potnatveg) .. 
    vm_bv(j2,"crop_per",potnatveg) =e=
      sum((crop_per30,w), vm_area(j2,crop_per30,w)) * fm_bii_coeff("crop_per",potnatveg) * fm_luh2_side_layers(j2,potnatveg);


*' regional cropland area is calculated for the cropland growth constraint
 q30_crop_reg(i2) .. v30_crop_area(i2)
   =e=
   sum((cell(i2,j2), kcr, w), vm_area(j2,kcr,w));
