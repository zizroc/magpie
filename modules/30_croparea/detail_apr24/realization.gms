*' @description This realization calculates the crop specific
*' agricultural crop area endogenously based on yield data provided by 
*' module [14_yields] and detailed rotational constraints.
*' In addition, corresponding carbons stocks and BII values are calculated.
*'
*' The crop specific interface `vm_area` is used in many other modules, 
*' including [18_residues], [38_factor_costs],
*' [41_area_equipped_for_irrigation], [42_water_demand], [50_nr_soil_budget],
*' [53_methane] and [59_som].
*'
*' This realization allows for different scenarios of rotational
*' constraints which are either implemented via hard constraints or penalty payments 
*' if constraints are exceeded. Rotational constraints are defined for total croparea 
*' as well as for irrigated areas only to avoid overspecialization on irrigated land.

*' @limitations There are currently no known limitations of this realization.
