*' Agricultural production is calculated by multiplying the area under
*' production with corresponding yields. Production from rainfed and irrigated
*' areas is summed up:

  q30_prod(j2,kcr) ..
    vm_prod(j2,kcr) =e= sum(w, vm_area(j2,kcr,w) * vm_yld(j2,kcr,w));

*' A penalty is applied for the violation of bioenergy tree (betr) rules.
*' The penalty applies to the missing bioenergy tree land, i.e. where bioenergy tree land 
*' is lower than a certain fraction of total cropland.

  q30_betr_missing(j2)$(sum(ct, i30_betr_penalty(ct)) > 0) ..
    v30_betr_missing(j2) =g=
      vm_land(j2,"crop") * sum(ct, i30_betr_target(ct,j2)) - vm_area(j2,"betr","rainfed");

*' Rotational constraints prevent over-specialization. In this realization,
*' they are either implemented via rules (i30_implementation = 1) or 
*' a penalty payment if the constraints are violated (i30_implementation = 0).

*' Rule-based rotational constraints (i30_implementation = 1):

*' Minimum and maximum rotational constraints limit
*' the placing of crops. These rotational constraints reflect
*' crop rotations limiting the share a specific crop can cover of the total area
*' of a cluster.

  q30_rotation_max(j2,rotamax_red30)$(i30_implementation = 1) ..
    sum((rota_kcr30(rotamax_red30,kcr),w), vm_area(j2,kcr,w)) =l=
      sum((kcr,w),vm_area(j2,kcr,w)) * sum(ct,i30_rotation_rules(ct,rotamax_red30));

      );

*' The penalty applies to the areas which exceed a certain maximum
*' share of the land. Below this share, negative benefits are
*' avoided by defining the penalty to be positive.

*' Minimum constraints apply penalties when a certain mimimum
*' share of a group is not achieved. This is used to guarantee a minimum
*' crop group diversity withing cells.

      - sum((rota_kcr30(rotamin_red30,kcr),w), vm_area(j2,kcr,w));


*' The following maximum constraint avoids over-specialization in irrigated systems.
*' No minimum constraint is included for irrigated areas for computational
*' reasons. Minimum constraints just need to be met on total areas.
